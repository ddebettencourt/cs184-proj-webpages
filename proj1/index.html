<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Overall, in this project I did several tasks relating to rasterization of triangles. I used both the line test and barycentric coordinates to find whether points were inside or outside 
  triangles, and then did several different kinds of sampling of textures, including using mipmaps and bilinear sampling. I also looked at supersampling and compared the various pros and cons
   of each method.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>I rasterize triangles in the following way: <br></br>
<ul>
<li>First, I compute the bounding box of the triangle by finding the minimum and maximum x and y values of the triangle.</li>
<li>Then, I check each pixel within the bounding box, and see if the center of the pixel is inside all three edges of the triangle, using the formula from Lecture 2. </li>
<li>If I get a result that the pixel is within all three edges (or outside all three edges, to account for differing orders of the vertices), then I fill in the pixel.</li>
</ul>
My algorithm is no worse than one that checks all samples within the bounding box of the triangle, because it does exactly that - check all samples within the bounding box of the triangle. 
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>My supersampling algorithm is fairly simple:
<ul>
<li>For every pixel, I added two extra loops into the rasterize_triangle function: one controlling the x_offset and one controlling the y_offset. The offsets are such that if we call sqrt(sample_rate) r, the offsets go from 1/2r to (2r-1)/(2r), incrementing by 1/r each time.</li>
<li>With every loop, one of these offsets is updated, and if the resulting point is inside the triangle, the sample buffer records the color. </li>
<li>When resolving to framebuffer, all of the supersamples for a specific pixel are retrieved from the sample buffer and averaged to create the color of the pixel.</li>
<li>The sample buffer was modified to be sample_rate times larger than before. This is to accommodate the extra information from the supersamples, and the information about a specific pixel is accessible from position (y * width + x) * sample_rate to position (y * width + x + 1) * sample_rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The results in basic/test4.svg, above, are observed because the supersampling allows for the skinny triangle to be gradually blended together, as opposed to each pixel being a binary off or on. This allows for greater resolution, as there are more options for the color of each pixel.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<p>Barycentric coordinates are a way of plotting a coordinate system in a triangle. 
  It uses three coordinates, each of which represents how close a given point is to one of the vertices of the triangle. 
  One of the easiest ways to think about it is that if you were to draw a line from the point to each vertex of the triangle, you would create three areas within the triangle. 
  The portion of the total area of the triangle that each of these areas cover are the three barycentric coordinates, which always add to 1. 
  <br></br>
  The below triangle illustrates this. Each vertex is a different color (either red, green, or blue), and the gradient represents the gradual shift in barycentric coordinates.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>I did pixel sampling in two ways: nearest-neighbor and bilinear. 

  <br></br>
  <b>Nearest-Neighbor Sampling</b>
  <br></br>
  For nearest-neighbor sampling, the first thing that I did was compute the barycentric coordinates of the pixel in question. If the pixel was inside the triangle, then 
  I computed the u and v coordinates of the texture using the formula (alpha * u0 or v0) + (beta * u1 or v1) + (gamma * u2 or v2). I then passed this through to 
  the texture.cpp file, which found the closest texel to the u and v coordinates given, and returned that color.
  <br></br>
  <b>Bilinear Sampling</b>
  <br></br>
  For bilinear sampling, I used the same process as nearest-neighbor sampling to generate the u and v coordinates. After this, I computed the four closest texels to this u and v coordinate
   in texture.cpp. After doing this, I interpolated the texels' color values using the linear interpolation method described in lecture (taking a weighted average based on the distance
    to each point), and returned this color as the color value of the pixel.
</p>

<p>
  The following images are an example of bilinear sampling being clearer than nearest-neighbor sampling, as the text is (slightly) more legible.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>I implemented level sampling in the following way:
<ul>
<li>For every pixel, I computed the barycentric coordinates for not only the pixel (x, y), but also (x+1, y) and (x, y+1).</li>
<li>If each of these pixels was inside the triangle, I computed its (u, v) coordinates using the formula from Part 5, and passed that through to texture.cpp.</li>
<li>texture.cpp then received three sets of (u, v) coordinates, as well as the selectors for which type of sampling to do.</li>
<li>After this, I found the "level" of the given sets of coordinates by using the formula log2(max(sqrt(diff_u_x^2 + diff_u_y^2), sqrt(diff_v_x^2 + diff_v_y^2))). This gives the approximate 
  level of mipmap to use (as if the difference between consecutive u and v coordinates is high, then it would make sense to use a lower resolution mipmap.)
</li>
<li>
  Then, I computed the texel at the given mipmap level, using either nearest-neighbor or bilinear sampling, and after applying a lot of checks to ensure that the coordinates were valid, I returned the color.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
  One major tradeoff between the types of sampling are that the speed is lowest with level-zero sampling, but the quality is also highest. This is similar to the tradeoff between supersampling
   with a high number of samples per pixel and a low number - when you have a high number of samples per pixel, you have to use more memory and it is slower, but you get better antialiasing.
  <br></br>
  With pixel sampling, the major tradeoff is again similar - if you use bilinear sampling, you have to use more memory and sacrifice speed, but you end up with usually a better-looking image.
  In contrast, if you use nearest-neighbor sampling, you have worse anti-aliasing but better speed and less memory used.

</div>

<p> It is interesting to note here that the bilinear sampling gives a worse result than nearest-neighbor (in my opinion). I think this could be because this image was generated 
  essentially pixel by pixel (it was my Scheme contest entry back in 61A). Bilinear sampling might be better for images without as hard of edges.
